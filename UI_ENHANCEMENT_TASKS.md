## Technical Specifications

### Enhanced Typing API Parameters
- `font_family`: String (jetbrains, system fonts)
- `font_size`: Integer (12-72 range)
- `text_color`: String (hex format #RRGGBB)
- `custom_text`: String (direct text input)
- `text_file`: File upload (.txt files only)
- `duration`: Integer (existing parameter)
- `output_format`: String (existing parameter)

### UI Components Required
- Font selection dropdown with preview
- Font size slider (12-72px range)
- Color picker with hex input
- Text area with character/line counter
- File upload with drag-and-drop
- Real-time preview panel
- Progress tracking for generation
- Download interface for completed videos

### Security Considerations
- File upload validation (type, size limits)
- Text input sanitization
- Color input validation
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Secure file storage and cleanup

---

## Notes
- Matrix rain functionality completely removed as requested
- Focus on clean, professional UI design
- Maintain existing Docker architecture
- Ensure backward compatibility for existing typing API calls
- All new features should follow project coding standards
- **Suggestions below can be implemented in any phase where it makes sense to add them**
