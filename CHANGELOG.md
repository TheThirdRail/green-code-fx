## Release Notes

### Version 1.0.0 - Initial Release

This is the first release of the Green-Code FX containerized video effects generator. The system provides a complete Docker-based solution for generating high-quality 4K chroma-key animations.

**Key Features:**
- **Typing Code Effect**: Simulates realistic code typing with customizable timing
- **Matrix Rain Effect**: Creates seamless looping digital rain animations
- **Web API**: RESTful interface for job management and file downloads
- **Headless Rendering**: Optimized for server environments without displays
- **High Quality Output**: 4K resolution with lossless H.264 encoding

**Deployment:**
- Single-command Docker deployment
- Port 8082 for API access
- Volume-mounted persistent storage
- Resource-limited containers for stability

**Security:**
- Non-root container execution
- Read-only filesystem protection
- Network isolation
- Input validation and sanitization

This release establishes the foundation for scalable video effects generation in containerized environments.
