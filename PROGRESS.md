- `src/web_api.py` - Flask routes and API endpoints (collaboration routes removed)
- `src/static/js/` - JavaScript modules (language presets removed)
- `src/batch_processor.py` - Batch processing logic (priority validation fixed)
- `src/static/css/` - Styling and visibility fixes (text contrast improved)

## Implementation Notes

**Critical Priority:** Fix generate button and core video generation first, as this is the primary application function.

**UI Issues:** Focus on CSS variable definitions and color contrast to resolve text visibility problems.

**Collaboration Removal:** Systematic removal required to avoid breaking dependencies - remove UI first, then backend APIs, finally cleanup imports.

**Testing Strategy:** Test each fix incrementally to ensure no regression in working features.
